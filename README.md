# GCN Front end Developer Task

My sample of the Global Cycling Network website for mobile.

## How to view

Either run the development mode server with `yarn start` or build and host yourself with `yarn build`.\
Alternatively view the demo on github page - https://butchmonkey.github.io/gcn-dev-site/

## Preview mock designs

I created mock designs for all pages before starting work on this project.\
Should you wish to view these designs, you can check out the figma project [here](https://www.figma.com/file/azCF93qFHpC65BezfPbysb/GCN?node-id=3%3A265)\

Pages include:

-   Scrapbook - This is my main playground for coming up with designs. It shows the iteration of each thought I had while designing.
-   Final - The final design that I settled on (suprising, I know)
-   Resources - A collection of icons, logos and colors that I planned on using
-   Components - A few grouped elements that makes it easier for importing onto other pages

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
